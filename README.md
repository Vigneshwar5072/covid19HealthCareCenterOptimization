# covid19HealthCareCenterOptimization
In response to anticipated resource shortfalls related to the treatment and testing of COVID-19, many communities are planning to build additional facilities to increase capacity. These facilities include field hospitals, testing centers,and distribution centers for medicine and treatment. Apparantly this challenging problem to the government agaencies as well, regarding where to setup the health care center.    Basically, in many cases, these facilities are intended to be temporary and are designed to meet an immediate need.   When deciding where to place new facilities many factors need to be considered, including the feasibility of potential locations, existing resource availability, anticipated demand, and accessibility between patients and the new facility cost.   In this project, a temporary health center location optimization model was developed to integrate these key pieces of information to help decision makers identify the best place, or places, to build a facility to meet anticipated resource demands.   The temporary health center  optimization model uses the location of existing resources and the anticipated resource demand at each location to minimize the distance a patient must travel to get to the resource they need.  The optimization formulation is presented below. The model was designed to operate at the county scale, where patients are grouped per county.
